## Overview

𰻝𰻝汉子 BiangBiang Hanzi is an application that allows users to convert Hanzi (Chinese characters) to Pinyin and translate Chinese text into any language. It supports both traditional and simplified Chinese characters and includes OCR capabilities for recognizing text from images, either live or from the camera.

This app has been developed using Swift and SwiftUI, leveraging the power of Apple's Vision framework for OCR functionality.

I developed this app to help myself and others learn Chinese more effectively by providing an easy way to read and understand Hanzi characters. It happened many times when I was in China in restaurants for example, I could not read the menu because I did not know how to pronounce the characters; but if I could know the pinyin I would have been able to read it out loud and order food. This app aims to solve that problem as well, aside from being a useful tool for learning Chinese in general.
